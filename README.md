Former distrohopper cli (stupid app to choose linux distributions randomly), this was a pet project to try crystal lang.

## Meet cfm.sh
**Choose for me shell**, is a command line tool that solves the problem of taking decitions. Don't know what to do next? No problem, cfm.sh solves that for you, just make a list and let it decide for you!
